#Maze To The Moon
#This project consists of the player starting at one point in a maze and trying to find their way out of the maze to the moon. There will be a counter keeping track of the amount of moves the player makes to get out of the maze. There will also be a timed counter that will show the amount of time in seconds the player is taking to get out of the maze. Once the player reaches the moon icon the game concludes and the player wins.
#Implemented with VGA and coded in Verilog
#See the mp4 video for how it works!
